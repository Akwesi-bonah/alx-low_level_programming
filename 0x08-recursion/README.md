# C - Recursion functions
Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.
## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:


- What is recursion
- How to implement recursion
- In what situations you should implement recursion
- In what situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion
